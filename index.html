<!--Since I'm really lost on this assignment(and it's not working), I'm going to explain what I want my code to do...

Game stored within .js file
Set up multiple user tags to identify each player uniquely as they join the game.
This could also be associated by their login, so they could play more than just this current session.
Using Firebase and the unique tag for the player as the ID, each user is individually saved along with their wins, losses and ties written to their ID on the Firebase server.
As each player joined, their ID would be written to Firebase and their position in queue would also be stored.
The data on Firebase would appear as follows:
"id" : unique user tag
"queue" : number representing where they are in the queue to play (changing to 0 or '' at the time of game play)
"current wins" : current wins against other current player; would begin as '' or 0.
"current losses" : same as above
"current ties" : same as above
"overall wins" : overall wins against all oppenents played
"overall losses" : same as above
"overall ties" : same as above
The two users would play a total of 5 rounds.  If there were still a tie, the game would go into "sudden death." 
The winner of the sudden death round(s) would be considered the winner that would play the next player in the queue.  
At the end of the game, both user's final scores against the apponent would be displayed.
The loser would be asked if they would like to play again and they would be placed at the back of the current queue of users waiting to play.
The loser's wins, losses and ties would be added to his overall record and his current scores cleared. 
If the winner has won more the game, then his record would indicate the score for this user as well as his overall score. Once displayed.  The scores would be added to his overall record and his current scored cleared for the next game.
The winner would then play the next user in the queue.
Play would continue until the winner lost.  
When the winner loses, his final scores would be posted and he would be asked if he would like to play again.  If he chooses to play again, he would be placed at the end of the queue.
The new winner would then be setup to play against the next player in the queue.
Play would continue until there were no more players in the queue, at which time, the  player would be notified that there are no other players to play with at this time and to check back later.  
If I had the knowledge; I would also add a feature that would allow them to choose to be notified when a player has logged in is available for play.
As for chatting during game play, I honestly have not researched this piece of it at all.  I believe it would work using the same unique player ID's and the player specifying which player he wants to taunt; or the chat would only be for the two players currently playing the game.-->
